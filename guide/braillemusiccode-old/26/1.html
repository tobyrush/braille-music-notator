  <h1>26. Fretted Plucked String Instruments</h1>
  <h2>26.1. Various Print Notation Systems</h2>
  <p>Transcribing music for fretted plucked instruments is complicated by the fact that there are many very different instruments associated with various geographical and historical sources. There are at least four print systems of notation for such instruments in current usage. Staff notation (discussed in Pars. <a href="../26/2.html">26.2</a>–<a href="../26/12.html">26.12</a>) is the system most likely to be encountered by the transcriber. The system of chord symbols, or “short-form scoring” (discussed in Secs. <a href="../23/1.html">23</a> and <a href="../27/1.html">27</a>), is frequently encountered in popular and folk music. The system of fret chord diagrams, or “picture notation,” (See Pars. <a href="../26/13.html">26.13</a>–<a href="../26/13_4.html">26.13.4</a>) may be found along with chord symbols. Tablature, a notation that is not associated with staff notation, cannot be represented in braille. (See Par. <a href="../26/14.html">26.14</a> regarding TAB, a related modern system for guitar or ukulele.) The application of these systems varies among countries and among publishers. The transcriber must have special knowledge of the technique of the particular instrument and the needs of the performer before undertaking such work. The braille schemes here set forth can, therefore, only be considered generalizations. The transcriber must make necessary adjustments, with suitable explanations in the braille transcription. Instruction materials for these instruments must be furnished with complete descriptions of the braille notation used, especially when the print varies from typical staff notation.</p>
