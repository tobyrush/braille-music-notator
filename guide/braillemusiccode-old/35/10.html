  <h1>35. Solo Songs and Choral Parts</h1>
  <h2>35.10. Parts Extracted from Choral Scores</h2>
  <p>Individual voice parts that are extracted by the transcriber from a choral score are transcribed in the same manner as a vocal solo. The transcriber must be careful to include relevant indications of expression and execution that may be shown in print above the top staff of the score or elsewhere and not duplicated near the part being extracted. Print page turns must be observed meticulously, and all rehearsal references must be included. If the print score shows measure numbers in places that are related to the print layout but not to the musical structure (i.e., at the beginning of each system or on every fifth or tenth measure), those numbers are not included in the transcription. In such cases it is advisable to show the measure number in the braille at the beginning of each parallel or of every second or third parallel.</p>
