  <h2>35.8. Braille Repeat Devices in Vocal Music</h2>
  <p>Part-measure and full-measure repeats and backward-numeral repeats may be employed in the music lines of vocal music, independently of repetitions or lack of repetition in the lyrics, so long as the original and repetition of the music are contained in the same parallel. Great care must be observed to assure that the repetitions are exact, except for changes of octave or of dynamics. Braille use of the da capo and dal segno procedures is appropriate when a substantial section of a song is repeated exactly in both music and text, at any distance from the original. (See Sec. <a href="../20/1.html">20</a>.) It should not be used for repetition of a short passage unless the passage recurs frequently; generally, short repetitions should be written out following the print. If there are variations of text or multiple lines of lyrics, it is advisable to transcribe the music fully.</p>
