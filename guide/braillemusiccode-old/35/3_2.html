  <h2>35.3. Syllables Carried between Parallels</h2>
  <h3>35.3.2. Continuation of the Notes</h3>
  <p>When the vowel sound is to be carried from the end of the music line of one parallel into the next corresponding music line, it is necessary to show the slurs and ties in both lines. When the last note in a parallel is tied to the first note of the next, the tie must be restated at the beginning of the second parallel. Syllabic slurs restated at the beginning of the second parallel must precede all other signs in the measure (or continuation of a divided measure) with the exception of longer word-sign expressions, strain repeats, and key and time signatures. If a note is both tied and slurred, the redundant slur is not shown with the tie except in a facsimile transcription; in that case the slur precedes the tie. Placement of syllabic slurs is dependent on how many notes there are in total and on how many fall before and after the division. (The following examples are contrived in order to illustrate the procedures compactly. It is normally preferable to carry an entire syllable to the new parallel rather than to divide it.)</p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>When there are only two or three notes in all, a single slur follows each note except the last one, and a restated slur must precede the first note of the second parallel.</li>
    <li>When there are four or more notes in all, a double slur follows the first of them, even if it is the last note of the first parallel. A single slur is placed after the last note of the first parallel unless the double slur is in that position.</li>
    <li>When there are four or more notes in all and no more than three of them fall into the second parallel, a single slur precedes each of the notes appearing in the second parallel.</li>
    <li>When there are more than four notes in all and more than three of them fall into the second parallel, a restated double slur precedes the first note of that parallel and a single slur precedes the last note of the group.</li>
  </ol>
