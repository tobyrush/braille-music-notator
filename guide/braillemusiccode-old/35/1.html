  <h1>35. Solo Songs and Choral Parts</h1>
  <h2>35.1. Principles of Line-by-Line Format</h2>
  <p>When lyrics and music are paired, the words begin at the margin and the corresponding music in the third cell of the following line. Either of the two lines may be carried into a run-over line (or lines, if necessary) beginning in cell 5, but there should not be run-overs of both lines in the same parallel. Successive subsequent run-overs, if they are required, also begin in cell 5. The syllables of the lyrics and the notes of the music must always be exactly paired. A music heading is centered above the first line of lyrics; no blank line is needed between the two. This basic structure of a parallel, called &quot;line-by-line format,&quot; is adjusted to accommodate various circumstances, as described in this and the following three sections. This section is concerned with solo songs and single parts extracted from a choral score. Instrumental accompaniments are not included in the transcription and are brailled separately, as described in Par. <a href="../29/8.html">29.8</a>. The transcriber must be careful to include relevant indications of expression and execution that may be shown in print with the accompaniment or elsewhere and not duplicated near the voice staff.</p>
