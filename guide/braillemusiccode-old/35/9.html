  <h2>35.9. Measure Numbers and Rehearsal References</h2>
  <p>Measure numbers are not usually included in the braille transcription of vocal music, the word text serving as the point of reference. However, an occasional measure number, placed at the beginning of the word line, may be helpful in music in which word phrases are repeated many times or when measure numbers appear in the accompaniment. A rehearsal marking that is either a letter or a number that is not an actual measure number must be given between word signs at the margin in a separate line above the word line. A rehearsal reference marking that is an actual measure number may be placed at the beginning of the word line and does not require word signs.</p>
