  <h1>11. In-Accord and Measure-Division Signs</h1>
  <h2>11.1. In-Accord Procedures</h2>
  <p>When, during the course of a measure, two or more simultaneous parts cannot be written as chords, they are written in succession and joined, without intervening spaces, by an in-accord sign. The parts presented in this way may comprise the entire measure, or the measure may be divided into convenient sections, each section being treated as an isolated unit. The associated sign for a full-measure in-accord and those for dividing the measure and joining part-measure in-accords are different. In all cases, the order in which the parts are written is governed by the same principles as those followed for the writing of intervals: treble parts from highest to lowest, bass parts from lowest to highest. (See Par. <a href="../9/2.html">9.2</a>.) The octave must always be marked for the first note after any of the signs, and it must also be marked at the beginning of a measure that follows a measure that ends with an in-accord.</p>
