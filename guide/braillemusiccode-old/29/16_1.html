  <h1>29. Keyboard Instruments</h1>
  <h2>29.16. Instrument-Specific Annotations</h2>
  <h3>29.16.1. Drawbar Organs</h3>
  <p>The tone qualities of a very popular model of electronic organ are controlled by sets of drawbars, which are adjusted to numbers on the drawbars. The positions of the drawbars in each set are printed as a line of figures that include dashes or spaces. The complete line of figures, along with any associated text, is included as a word-sign expression. To save space, only the first numeric indicator of each figure is brailled. The initial settings may be tabulated in the same manner as an initial registration before the movement or section. If one or more drawbars are readjusted during the course of the music, the whole group is given with the changed figures underlined. In the braille, dot 3 is added to the cell showing each underlined digit.</p>
