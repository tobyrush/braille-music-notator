  <h1>29. Keyboard Instruments</h1>
  <h2>29.15. Directions for Organ Registration</h2>
  <h3>29.15.1. Preset Devices</h3>
  <p>Groups of stops are often controlled by buttons (often called pistons) that are programmed before performance begins. The arrangement of preset devices is unique to each instrument. Activation of the buttons is usually indicated in print by encircled numbers or letters. They are represented in braille as word-sign expressions. If two or more buttons are indicated at the same place, they are separated by spaces between the same pair of word signs. If the indications could be mistaken for other word- sign markings (such as a button marked <i>C</i> which would appear to indicate a crescendo) it is advisable to add a prefix such as the letter <i>p</i> before the indication, or to assume that the circle or box around the letter is the equivalent of parentheses and to enclose the indication between special parentheses within the word-sign expression. Any deviation from the print must be explained in a transcriberâ€™s note. In the following example it is arbitrarily assumed that the encircled number represents a &quot;general piston&quot; that affects stops in all divisions of the organ, and that the letter within the box represents a piston that affects only the registration of the pedal board.</p>
