  <h1>29. Keyboard Instruments</h1>
  <h2>29.4. Combined Parts and Visiting Hands</h2>
  <p>When a single melodic line is shared by the hands or chords alternate between the hands, it is often advantageous to combine the parts in some manner. Hand assignments and direction of interval reading must be clearly indicated. Intervals are always read in the direction established by the initial hand sign of each “host” part. When the music played by a “visiting” hand includes intervals, the direction for reading the intervals must be reinforced in one of two ways: the appropriate special hand sign indicating interval direction may be used, as shown in Example <a href="../29/4_2.html">29.4.2-2</a>, or a statement regarding interval direction in visiting hands may be included in the required transcriber's note. (See Par. <a href="../9/2.html">9.2</a>.)</p>
