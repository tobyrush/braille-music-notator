  <h1>33. Instrumental Ensemble Scores</h1>
  <h2>33.6. Parallel Movement</h2>
  <p>When parts are doubled by different instruments, at the unison or in any octave, the doubling may be shown by the parallel movement sign - which is the same as the octave interval. The device may only be used when all markings are identical, with the exception of octave marks and expression marks at the commencements of measures. It is normally used only for complete measures, although it may be used for a portion of a measure that is divided between parallels. When the doubling is in an octave other than unison with the original, an octave mark is required for each parallel-movement sign. The octave of the first note that follows use of the device in any voice must be marked. The device may be used under the following two conditions:</p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>When the instruments are located consecutively in the score, the uppermost of the parts is transcribed in full, and the parallel movement device is shown in each of the subsequent parts.</li>
    <li>When a very important and obvious melody line is doubled by instruments at some distance from one another in the score, the uppermost of the parts is written out. The parallel movement sign in each doubling part is followed by the abbreviation of the name of the instrument that has the melody written out. If the doubling continues in the same parallel, it is not necessary to restate the abbreviation following the parallel movement sign in the subsequent measures in that parallel.</li>
  </ol>
