  <h1>33. Instrumental Ensemble Scores</h1>
  <h2>33.2. List of Instruments</h2>
  <p>Immediately following the title, a two-column table lists all of the instruments included in the score. In the first column the names appear in the order they are given on the first page of the printed score whether they have notes or rests in those measures. This name column includes all of the information that is given on the first page of the printed music, including the keys of transposing instruments. The second column, which is left-aligned beginning two cells beyond the last cell of the longest of the names, gives the abbreviations that are employed to identify the instruments in the transcription. The following conditions apply:</p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>No contractions are employed.</li>
    <li>Unified English Braille signs for accidentals and letter modifiers are used when English is the language of the score. Accented letters in a foreign-language score are brailled with the characters for those symbols in that language.</li>
    <li>An instrument line may run over to a second line, if necessary, indented to cell 3 or to cell 5 if there are two or more instruments of the same name on separate staves.</li>
    <li>Two or more dot-5 guide dots are inserted to fill out the width of a column when an instrument name ends three or more cells before the end of the longest name. One space separates the end of the name and the beginning of the guide dots.</li>
    <li>If there is not room on the first page for the title, the table of instruments, the music heading preceded by a blank line, and the first full parallel of music, the music heading and first parallel must begin on the next page.</li>
  </ol>
