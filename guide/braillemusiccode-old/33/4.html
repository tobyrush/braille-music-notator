  <h1>33. Instrumental Ensemble Scores</h1>
  <h2>33.4. The Parallel</h2>
  <p>Each music line of the parallel (except a run-over line, as described in Par. <a href="../33/4_7.html">33.4.7</a>) begins at the margin with the abbreviation of the instrument name, including a key signature if it is required. The music of each line begins one space beyond the end of the longest abbreviation, including key signatures if they are required. No attempt is made to exclude dynamic markings or other expressions from the alignment. If the parallel contains more than one measure, the first signs of the measures are vertically aligned in all parts, with guide dots inserted where there are more than six blank cells. The first note of every braille line must have an octave mark; the first notes of succeeding measures in the line, however, do not need the special octave marks required in keyboard music.</p>
