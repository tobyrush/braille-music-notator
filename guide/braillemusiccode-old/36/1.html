  <h1>36. Chord Symbols with Lyrics</h1>
  <h2>36.1. Expansion of Parallel to Include Chord Symbols</h2>
  <p>Where words, chord symbols, and a melody are present, they are combined in an expanded line-by-line format consisting of a three-line parallel. Words are placed on the first line, corresponding chord symbols on the second line, and the corresponding melody on the third line. Run-overs of the word lines are not permitted. The word line always starts at the margin with a word, a syllable, a spacing device consisting of two cells of dots 36, or a measure number. The chord symbols, as described in Sec. <a href="../23/1.html">23</a>, are placed in relation to the syllables of the words, and the spacing of the syllables within the word line may be adjusted to accommodate the requirements of the chord symbols. The music line always starts in cell 3 (with run-overs, if needed, starting in cell 5) and is transcribed in relation to the lyrics as directed in Sec. <a href="../35/1.html">35</a>.</p>
