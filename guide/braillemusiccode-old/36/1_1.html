  <h1>36. Chord Symbols with Lyrics</h1>
  <h2>36.1. Expansion of Parallel to Include Chord Symbols</h2>
  <h3>36.1.1. Required Transcriber's Note</h3>
  <p>A series of paragraphs must be given on the Transcriberâ€™s Notes page of any transcription that contains chord symbols with lyrics. Each of the following statements (not including the parenthetical letter) that is applicable to the particular transcription should be included as a separate paragraph, in the order shown below.</p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>The chord symbols in this song relate to the words; the position of the initial capital sign in each chord symbol determines whether the chord is played before, with, during, or after the related word or syllable.</li>
    <li>Punctuation marks and repetition signs in the word line have no bearing on the relative position of the initial sign of a chord. When a word is capitalized, the braille capital sign is considered the first character of the word.</li>
    <li>The abnormal appearance and spacing of some words is made necessary by the amount of space required for the correct placement of each chord symbol.</li>
    <li>If the chord is sounded before the syllable, its initial capital sign is located two spaces to the left in the line below the initial character of the syllable.</li>
    <li>If the chord is sounded with the syllable, its initial capital sign is vertically aligned below the initial character of the syllable.</li>
    <li>If the chord is sounded during the syllable, its initial capital sign is preceded by a hyphen; when it is the first chord sounded during the syllable, the hyphen is aligned below the initial character of the syllable.</li>
    <li>If the chord is sounded after the syllable is released, its initial capital sign is located one space to the right in the line below the final letter of the syllable.</li>
  </ol>
