  <h1>36. Chord Symbols with Lyrics</h1>
  <h2>36.2. Adjustment of Spacing of Words</h2>
  <p>If the length of a chord symbol (or symbols) extends beyond the end of a word or syllable in the lyric, the necessary space(s) are left between them. If the word must be divided between syllables to accommodate the length of a chord symbol, a hyphen is inserted between the syllables, along with any following spaces that may be needed. Where the space required by the symbols necessitates a separation of four or more cells between words or after the hyphen between syllables, a series of two or more dots 36 is inserted in the word line, with a blank cell before and after the series. The first word or syllable that follows a chord symbol that is initiated by a hyphen must be placed at least two spaces to the right of that hyphen so that the new word or syllable cannot become associated with the previous chord.</p>
