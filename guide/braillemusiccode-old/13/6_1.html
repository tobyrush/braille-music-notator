  <h1>13. The Slur</h1>
  <h2>13.6. Slurs between Parts</h2>
  <h3>13.6.1. Slurs between In-Accord Parts</h2>
  <p>Where a slur passes from one in-accord part to another in the same staff, the &quot;sending&quot; sign <span class="braille">_C</span> is placed after the last note of the slurred phrase to appear in the part in which the slur begins, the &quot;originating&quot; part. The &quot;continuation&quot; sign <span class="braille">._c</span> is placed before the first note of the continuation of the phrase in the &quot;receiving&quot; part. Use of these signs is adjusted under various conditions as follows:</p>
  <p>(a) In a short phrase, the sending sign replaces the single slur that would have followed the last note in the originating part if the phrase had been fully contained in a single part. The continuation sign precedes the first note of the continuation in the receiving part, and any remaining single slurs are given as usual if the continuation includes two or three notes.</p>
  <p>(b) In a long slur using bracket slurs, the continuation sign may be omitted if the continuation is located at the beginning of the following measure or parallel.</p>
  <p>(c) In a long slur using doubled slurs, when the portion of the phrase in the originating part consists of only one note, the sending slur is doubled by restating its second cell and replaces the initial double slur that would have followed the first note if the phrase had been continued in that part.</p>
  <p>(d) In a long slur using doubled slurs, when the portion of the phrase in the receiving part consists of only one note, the continuation sign serves to terminate the slur. If the portion of the phrase in the receiving part includes two or more notes, the continuation sign is doubled by restating its third cell, but may be omitted if the continuation is located at the beginning of the following measure or parallel; termination of the slur is given as usual by placing a single slur after the next-to-last note of the phrase.</p>
