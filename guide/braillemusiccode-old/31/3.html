  <h1>31. Harps</h1>
  <h2>31.3. Damping of Strings</h2>
  <p>The signs <span class="braille">*C</span> and <span class="braille">&lt;C</span> are used in braille to represent, respectively, damping and not damping strings. These are the same signs as are used in piano music to represent &quot;pedal-up&quot; (damped) and &quot;pedal-down&quot; (not damped). Note that the usual condition in piano music is damped, while in harp music the usual condition is undamped. In harp music, damping (stopping the vibration) of a string or strings is usually shown in print by an encircled cross. (This use of an encircled cross must not be confused with the use of an encircled cross symbol to indicate a coda in the D.C. and D.S. procedures.) The symbol may be accompanied by the French word &quot;&eacute;touffer,&quot; or the word may be used without the symbol. The word is transcribed as a word-sign expression wherever it appears. The encircled cross represented by the sign <span class="braille">*c</span> is employed as required by any of many circumstances, some of which are illustrated in Pars. <a href="../31/3_1.html">31.3.1â€“31.3.7</a>. These provisions may apply:</span>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>If a fingering is given for the act of damping a string, the fingering sign must immediately follow the damping sign.</li>
    <li>The associated notes may be printed as notes of rhythmic value, as small notes, or as note heads without stems that are not counted in the rhythmic content of the measure; it may sometimes be necessary to provide transcriber-added rests (preceded by dot 5) if the valueless notes occupy visually measured space in the print.</li>
    <li>A damping sign that is printed before or concurrent with a rest, either written or implied, is brailled before the rest.</li>
  </ol>
