  <h1>7. Meter Indications and Time Devices</h1>
  <h2>7.2. Real-Time Devices</h2>
  <p>When durations are given in actual time (usually in seconds) rather than in measures of beats using standard note values, most print presentations are variants of either of two graphical approaches. A number may be written above a note, rest, or action to indicate how long, in seconds, it is to be executed; a bracket of some sort is sometimes associated with the number. Otherwise, units of time may be indicated by print “ticks” of some sort above the staff. Such devices are not standardized. However, the device is usually explained in a composer’s or publisher’s remark. In all cases, a transcriber’s note is required. The following two illustrations are suggestions for transcribing typical presentations.</p>
