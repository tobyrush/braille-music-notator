  <h3>19.1.2 Measure-Number Repeats</h3>
  <p>Measure numbers can be used effectively to indicate repetition of single measures or of passages of full measures, even when the repetitions are at some distance from the originals. The numbers are brailled, between spaces, using lower-cell numerals. When only one measure is to be repeated, only the number of the original measure is given. If a series of measures is to be repeated, the beginning and ending measure numbers of the original passage are given, connected by a literary hyphen; the numeric indicator is not restated. Discretion is required; it is not advisable to refer back to an isolated measure that is far removed from the point of repetition. There is no limit to the length of the repeated passage. However, reference should only be made to measures on a previous braille page if the passage to be repeated is very extensive or frequently repeated. It is advisable but not mandatory to position the original measure or passage at the beginning of a segment or parallel so that it is easily located.</p>
