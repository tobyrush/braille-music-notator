  <h1>19. Braille Numeral Repeats</h1>
  <h2>19.1. Braille Repeats Using Numerals</h2>
  <p>In instrumental music, repetition of a passage of one or more full measures may be shown in braille by one of two devices using numerals, even if it is separated from the original by intervening music. The backward-numeral repeat, sometimes called partial abbreviation, instructs the reader to count a number of measures back and repeat a number of measures from that point. The measure-number repeat, sometimes called the forward-numeral repeat, instructs the reader to locate and repeat a specific range of measures using their absolute numbers in the score. Discretion is required. A short-term repeat may be nested within a longer- term repeat when both the original and the repeat are entirely contained within the longer-term repeat. However, a numeral repeat must never point to a second numeral repeat that is not nested in that way. The first note following any numeral repeat must have an octave mark. Only backward-numeral repeats are used in vocal music, and then only under limited circumstances. (See Par. <a href="../35/8.html">35.8</a>.)</p>
