  <h1>34. Percussion</h1>
  <h2>34.2. Typical Braille Transcription</h2>
  <h3>34.2.1. Note Names</h3>
  <p>Music for pitched instruments is transcribed the same as keyboard music. When the music for unpitched instruments is printed in a five-line staff, the letter names of notes are used as if they were written in bass (F) clef. When it is printed on single or multiple horizontal lines, any notes may be used; the note C is the one most commonly used. The assignment of notes to unpitched instruments must always be given in the table of instruments at the beginning of the score or on the Special Symbols page or Transcriber’s Notes page.</p>
