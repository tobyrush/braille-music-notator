  <h1>34. Percussion</h1>
  <h2>34.1. Categories of Print Scores</h2>
  <p>Music for percussion includes many kinds of scores. In some cases, it is clear that the music is intended for one performer or for specific individuals, to be played on one or more instruments. However, in music that is to be performed by an ensemble or by the percussion section of an orchestra or band, even the number of players is often not specified, and the matching of instruments with players is to be decided in rehearsal. Typical arrangements are:</p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Music for a pitched instrument, such as a set of bells, a xylophone, or a set of kettledrums, is printed on a staff or grand staff. Appropriate clef signs are used.</li>
    <li>Music for a single unpitched instrument such as a drum or triangle may be printed in a staff, occupying only one line or space, or it may be printed on a single horizontal line intersected by vertical bar lines. Either a contrived clef sign or a bass clef sign may be shown when the staff is employed.</li>
    <li>Music for an instrument, such as a set of temple blocks or cymbals of different sizes, that produces sounds of different non- specific pitches, is usually printed on the lines and spaces of a staff, often with x-shaped note heads to indicate that the pitches are not specific. Either a contrived clef sign or a bass clef sign may be shown.</li>
    <li>Music for a collection of unpitched instruments that is to be played by a small group of players may be notated in a series of horizontal lines intersected by vertical barlines, or it may be given in staves utilizing lines and spaces to indicate the various instruments. Sometimes two instruments may be shown on one horizontal line by designating up-stems for one and down-stems for the other. The assignment of lines and/or the lines and spaces of the staff is usually specified by abbreviations or icons, and may be changed in the course of the score. When the instruments are not named in a part labeled &quot;drums,&quot; written on a five-line staff, the lowest space (A) is usually for bass drum and the third space (E) is usually for snare drum.</li>
    <li>Music for a drum kit, an assemblage of instruments to be played by a single musician, usually associated with jazz or popular genres, is printed in a single staff utilizing the lines and spaces to indicate the various components of the set. Either a bass clef sign or a contrived clef sign may be shown.</li>
    <li>Music for the percussion section of an orchestra or band, or for an ensemble of percussionists may be printed in a combination of any or all of these formats.</li>
