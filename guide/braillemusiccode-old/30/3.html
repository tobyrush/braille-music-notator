  <h1>30. Figured Bass and Harmonic Analysis</h1>
  <h2>30.3. Figured Bass in Vertical Mode</h2>
  <p>In the vertical manner of presentation, the first figure appears directly below the bass note with which it is associated, with the remaining figures in a vertical column as they appear in print, with the following stipulations:</p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>The figured-bass sign is not used.</li>
    <li>When the note is preceded by a modifier such as an octave mark, an accidental, or a nuance, the numeric indicator is written below that sign and the figure itself falls directly below the note. If the note is not preceded by such a modifier, the numeric indicator is placed to the left of the note, so that the figure is aligned below the note. It must be absolutely clear which note is associated with the figure.</li>
    <li>Numerals are written in the lower part of the cell even where they are not shown with the numeric indicator.</li>
    <li>A plus sign is represented by dots 346 and is treated as if it were an accidental.</li>
    <li>The numeric indicator occurs only for the top figure of the column. The numeric indicator is used even when that figure is an accidental or other figure.</li>
    <li>An accidental appearing in conjunction with a numeral is placed after the numeral, even if it has been printed before it.</li>
    <li>When there are successive figures or columns of figures below a sustained note, the horizontal numerals in the top row are connected by one or more literary hyphens <span class="braille">-</span> between them. Since the numerals in the lower rows are vertically aligned, it is not necessary to insert hyphens in those rows.</li>
    <li>A line of continuation is represented by dot 1. If it is the first figure in a column it is preceded by the numeric indicator, as is any other figure.</li>
    <li>Spaces must often be left in the music line in order to achieve the alignment. Where the horizontal placement of the figures leaves blank spaces in the music line, the special bar line <span class="braille">l</span> may be used to separate measures. (See Par. <a href="../1/10_2.html">1.10.2</a> regarding use of this sign.) Alternatively, the music hyphen may be used when there are two or more successive spaces, the vertical coincidence of spaces in all lines serving to show the separation of measures.</li>
    <li>No run-over lines are permitted.</li>
    <li>A blank line must be left between successive segments or parallels.</li>
  </ol>
