  <h1>30. Figured Bass and Harmonic Analysis</h1>
  <h2>30.4. Harmonic Analysis</h2>
  <p>In print, for the purpose of chordal analysis, roman numerals are typically combined with arabic numerals and other figures in a format similar to that of figured bass. In braille, the first sign of the chord symbol is placed below the note with which it is associated, and the remaining characters follow horizontally. Spaces are introduced into the music line as necessary, and guide dots are inserted where seven or more successive spaces occur. The separation of measures may be shown by either method, employing the special bar line sign or employing the music hyphen. The following stipulations apply:</p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>The first letter of the roman numeral falls directly below the note. When the note is preceded by a modifier or modifiers such as an octave mark, accidental, or nuance, the capital sign or lowercase indicator is written below the last cell before the note.</li>
    <li>For any instance showing chordal analysis that includes other voices along with the bass melody, all intervals must be read upward. When the score is for keyboard, the sign for right hand reading intervals upward <span class="braille">.>></span> must be used.</li>
    <li>Only the single capital sign is used for any capitalized roman numeral. A lowercase indicator is used for every lowercase roman numeral.</li>
    <li>The associated arabic numerals and/or accidentals modifying or replacing numerals follow the roman numeral (and any intervening symbol such as a small circle, a triangle, or a plus sign) without a space, and are introduced by a single numeric indicator. A column of figures is read upward from the lowest. Numerals are given in the lower part of the cell. An accidental precedes the numeral to which it applies even if it has been printed following the numeral. An isolated accidental is followed by dots 13 to separate it from the following braille symbol except when it is followed by a space.</li>
    <li>Print parentheses are represented by the music parenthesis signs.</li>
    <li>An initial indication of key is given at the margin, preceded by the capital or lowercase indicator and employing the music sign for flat or sharp as appropriate, and follows print regarding punctuation. No space is needed between a key indication and adjacent chords unless it is required by some other factor. A key indication that occurs within a line is brailled preceding the first character of the following chord, which is normally a capital sign or a lowercase indicator.</li>
    <li>An analysis such as &quot;V of ii&quot; is brailled as it appears, including the interior spaces. The chords are aligned so that the first sign appears directly under the bass note. (See Examples <a href="../30/4_1.html">30.4.1-2</a> and <a href="../30/4_2.html">30.4.2-1</a>.)</li>
    <li>Intervals should not be doubled unless all concurrent intervals are doubled.</li>
    <li>A blank line must be left between successive parallels or segments.</li>
  </ol>
