  <h1>30. Figured Bass and Harmonic Analysis</h1>
  <h2>30.2. Figured Bass in Horizontal Mode</h2>
  <h3>30.2.1. Accidentals, Oblique Strokes, and &quot;Crossed&quot; Numerals</h3>
  <p>An accidental that modifies a figure precedes the figure to which it applies even if it has been printed following the figure. An isolated accidental is followed by dots 13 to separate it from the following braille symbol except when it is followed by a space. A plus sign is represented by dots 346 and is treated as if it were an accidental. A figure that is &quot;crossed&quot; (indicating that it is inflected upward) is preceded by dots 56. An oblique stroke that appears as a figure is represented by dots 34 following the numeric indicator.</p>
