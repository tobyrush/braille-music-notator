  <h1>30. Figured Bass and Harmonic Analysis</h1>
  <h2>30.1. Figured Bass</h2>
  <p>Figured bass, as the term implies, always consists of a bass melody in a staff, along with numbers, accidentals, and other figures that are printed above or below the staff. There may be associated music printed either in a keyboard score or in an instrumental ensemble score. It should be noted that figured bass is, by definition, a sort of musical shorthand, and is not consistently applied among publications, nor, in fact, even within a composition. The transcriber must not be tempted to interpret it, but only to represent it faithfully.</p>
