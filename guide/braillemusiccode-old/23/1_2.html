  <h1>23. Chord Symbols</h1>
  <h2>23.1. Transcribing Chord Symbols</h2>
  <h3>23.1.2. Characters That Are Not Alphanumeric</h3>
  <p>The braille music symbols for accidentals are used where the print symbols appear. Table <a href="../t/1_23.html">23</a> contains most of the other characters that are found in chord symbols. Some print symbols, such as the small circle (diminished) and small circle with a line through it (half-diminished), have standard meanings. The meanings of some other signs are not standardized. Those meanings are usually explained in accompanying text, which must, of course, be included in the transcription. The transcriber may have to devise appropriate braille signs to represent characters that are not included in this table, defining them in a transcriberâ€™s note.</p>
