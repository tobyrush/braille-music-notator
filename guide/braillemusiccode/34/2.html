  <h1>34. Percussion</h1>
  <h2>34.2. Typical Braille Transcription</h2>
  <p>It is normal for percussion music to include many instructions. In a transcription that is longer than a few pages, such notations that appear more than once should be given in a Special Symbols page. Explanations of braille symbols and devices should be included there along with the related notations. Transcriptions, except drum kit scores as described in Par. <a href="../34/7.html">34.7</a>, are generally formatted as follows:</p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>A part for a single performer using a single instrument is transcribed in single-line format. A set of like instruments of different sizes, such as temple blocks or tom-toms, may be treated as a single instrument.</li>
    <li>A part that includes two or more instruments concurrently, for one performer or for an ensemble, and whether it is printed in multiple staves or in one staff, is transcribed as an instrumental ensemble score as described in Sec. <a href="../33/1.html">33</a>, showing each instrumentâ€™s music in a separate line, designated by an abbreviation at the margin. A set of like instruments of different sizes is treated as a single instrument. Three exceptions to the rules of Sec. <a href="../33/1.html">33</a> are that backward-numeral repeats may be used extensively, that only one blank line is required between successive parallels, and that a third column may be added to the table of instruments to show assigned note names. (See Examples <a href="../34/2_3.html">34.2.3-2</a> and <a href="../34/7.html">34.7-1</a>.) The abbreviations from Table <a href="../29/1.html">29</a> should be used where they are applicable.</li>
    <li>To conserve space in either of these two formats, music for instruments that are never employed simultaneously may be shown in one part with the abbreviations from the list of instruments identifying each change of instrument in that line. (See Example <a href="../34/5.html">34.5-1</a>.)</li>
  </ol>
