  <h2>20.1. Da Capo and Dal Segno Procedures</h2>
  <h3>20.1.1. The Segno Point</h3>
  <p>When the repetition is D.C., from the beginning of the score, obviously no marking is required. When the repetition is D.S., the braille segno <span class="braille">+</span> is transcribed between spaces where the symbol occurs in the print, or at the beginning of the passage to be repeated when the use of the device is braille-only. A new segment or parallel must always be introduced at the beginning of the passage to be repeated. Thus, the segno will always be the first music sign of that line. A segno point may occur at any place in a measure. Any doubling that is in progress where the segno passage commences must be re-marked there. In print, only one segno repetition occurs in a movement. However, braille-only use of the device allows for more than one. Therefore, each braille segno sign is followed immediately by a letter (<i>a, b, c,</i> etc.) according to its position as the first, second, third, etc., segno in the movement. The letter a is included even when there is only one braille-only segno. Segno repeats may never overlap.</p>
