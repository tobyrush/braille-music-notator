  <h1>20. Da Capo and Dal Segno Repeats</h1>
  <h2>20.1. Da Capo and Dal Segno Procedures</h2>
  <p>In print, repetition of a passage of any length and at any distance from the original may be shown by the indication &quot;D.C.&quot; or &quot;da capo&quot; if the passage is at the beginning of the movement, or by &quot;D.S.&quot; or &quot;dal segno&quot; if the beginning of the passage is marked with a segno (a very ornate letter S). Four points in the score are designated where they are required: the segno point, the end of the repetition, the point of execution, and the point of continuation. With some modifications, the D.C. and D.S. devices may be used to show such repetitions in braille when they have not been used in the print. This braille-only use of the devices is employed instead of numeral repeats in vocal music, and also in orchestral and ensemble scores where measure numbers have not necessarily been prominently displayed. They may sometimes be more convenient than numeral repeats in single-line or keyboard music, especially when the repeated passage begins or ends with a partial measure. The first note following any of the signs employed with these procedures must have an octave mark.</p>
