  <h3>20.1.5. Point of Continuation</h3>
  <p>In print, the continuation of music following the D.C. or D.S. instruction is usually marked as a coda, a refrain, or by some other term. If an encircled cross has been printed along with the term, the cross sign is not included in the braille. If the continuation is of substantial length, in all braille formats the term is centered, followed by a literary period, in a free line (along with any accompanying key or time changes). If the continuation is very brief and not distinguished by a change of tempo, key, and/or meter, the term may be placed between word signs in a line by itself; in single-line format and in vocal music, it should be positioned at the margin; in bar-over-bar format it should be placed two cells to the right of the hand signs. When the device is braille-only, a new segment or parallel must be started, but no special marking is required.</p>
