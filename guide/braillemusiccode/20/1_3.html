  <h2>20.1. Da Capo and Dal Segno Procedures</h2>
  <h3>20.1.3. End of the Repetition Leading to a Continuation</h3>
  <p>In print, when the music is to be continued from a given point, the end of the passage to be repeated is marked by an encircled cross and/or an instruction such as &quot;al coda.&quot; The encircled-cross sign <span class="braille">+L</span> and/or the instruction is brailled between spaces where it appears. If the indication is printed during a measure, the music must be interrupted by the music hyphen. When use of the device is braille-only, the encircled cross sign is not used, and the end of the passage is shown by the sign <span class="braille">*</span> followed by a space. However, if the sign coincides with a double bar or any similar indication, it precedes such indication without an intervening space. If the end of a braille-only repeated passage occurs during a measure, the sign must be followed by the music hyphen before the required space, unless it coincides with a double bar or similar indication.</p>
