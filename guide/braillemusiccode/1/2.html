  <h1>1. General Procedures and Signs</h1>
  <h2>1.2. Use of English Contractions</h2>
  <p>By international agreement, literary braille contractions are not generally employed in music transcriptions. However, contractions may be used in English lyrics for chants, hymnals, and school materials for grades K–6. At the transcriber’s discretion, the literary portions of a publication, including titles, composers’ and arrangers’ names, running heads, dedications, introductions, contents pages, copyright notices, etc. may be contracted when they are in English. However, contractions must not be used in English literary passages or phrases that directly affect musical interpretation, such as music headings, terms of tempo or mood, word-sign expressions, and transcriber’s notes.</p>
