  <h1>1. General Procedures and Signs</h1>
  <h2>1.12. Doubling of Signs</h2>
  <p>Many signs may be doubled when they occur four or more times in succession. Single-cell signs are doubled by brailling the sign twice. Some two-cell or three-cell signs are doubled by restating the complete sign, while others are doubled by restating only part of the sign. All doublings are terminated by brailling the sign once at its last successive occurrence in the print. Each sign that may be doubled is identified in this work where the sign is introduced, and the method of doubling is specified in the case of each such two-cell or three-cell sign.</p>
