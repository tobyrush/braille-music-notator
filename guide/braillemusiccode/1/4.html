  <h1>1. General Procedures and Signs</h1>
  <h2>1.4. Preliminary Pages</h2>
  <p>Preliminary pages are brailled according to the procedures given in the current edition of <em>Braille Formats: Principles of Print-to- Braille Transcription,</em> with the following exceptions:</p>
  <p>(a) To facilitate international exchange of music transcriptions, all title pages must be <em>written</em> entirely in uncontracted braille. This requirement includes title, composer, publisher, and all other information that appears on the title page.</p>
  <p>(b) The music formats (methods) employed in the score must be clearly stated on the title page.</p>
  <p>(c) Both print and braille page numbers are placed in line 1 of each braille page. Running and inclusive print pages, where they are required, are placed at the left, and the running braille page numbers with <em>t</em> (transcriber) and <em>p</em> (print) are placed at the right.</p>
  <p>(d) When symbols from two or more different braille codes or special categories are to be included on a Special Symbols page, a separate list such as &quot;Music Braille,&quot; &quot;Unified English Braille,&quot; or &quot;Spanish Language Symbols&quot; should be given for signs from each code or category. Each list is preceded by an appropriate cell-5 heading.</p>
  <p>(e) When a Contents page is included, the print page numbers are replaced by the appropriate braille page numbers.</p>
