  <h1>1. General Procedures and Signs</h1>
  <h2>1.2. Use of English Contractions</h2>
  <h3>1.2.1. Contracted English Braille in Lyrics</h3>
  <p>When, as noted above, contractions are used in English lyrics for chants, hymnals, and school materials for grades Kâ€“6, or by special request for a client, they are brailled according to the current edition of <em>The Rules of Unified English Braille,</em> with the following exceptions:</p>
  <p>(a) Because of their special functions under the music code, the contractions for &quot;in&quot; <span class="braille">9</span> and &quot;ar&quot; <span class="braille">></span> may not appear as the first or last sign of a symbols-sequence. The &quot;in&quot; contraction may be used when it represents the whole word &quot;in&quot; and is preceded and followed by spaces.</p>
  <p>(b) When, in such lines of lyrics, a word or number is to be shown italicized or fully capitalized to show that it is not to be sung, it is preferable to fully capitalize rather than to italicize. If such lyrics include italics and full capitalization, some other symbol of emphasis should be used and explained in the Transcriber's Notes page.</p>
