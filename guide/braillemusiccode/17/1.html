  <h2>17.1. Initial and Terminal Repeat Signs</h2>
  <p>A double bar followed by dots in the staff, indicating the start of a passage to be repeated, is represented by the sign <span class="braille">&lt;7</span> in braille. This sign is part of the measure: it is placed without an intervening space or dot 3 before the first sign connected with the measure or incomplete measure in which it appears, unless that first sign is an expression that contains one or more spaces, in which case an intervening music hyphen and space must precede the expression. (See Par. <a href="../22/3_8.html">22.3.8</a>.) When the repeated passage extends beyond one braille line, it is usually advisable to place it at the beginning of a segment or parallel. If this sign occurs during a measure, the preceding sign must be followed by a music hyphen and a space. A double bar preceded by dots, indicating the end of a passage to be repeated, is represented by the sign <span class="braille">&lt;2</span> in braille. It is placed without intervening space after the last sign connected with the measure or incomplete measure in which it appears. If this sign occurs during a measure that is afterwards continued in the same braille line, it must be followed by the music hyphen and a blank space. The first note following either sign must have a special octave mark.</p>
