  <h1>24. Instrumental Solos and Ensemble Parts</h1>
  <h2>24.1. Single-Line Format</h2>
  <p>Music that consists of a single part, such as an instrumental solo or the part for a participant in an ensemble, is presented in single-line format. The transcriber divides the music into appropriate segments, based on the structure and phrasing of the composition. A typical segment consists of two to four lines of braille. The transcriber has great latitude in determining the segments. The objective is for each segment to be easily memorized by the expected reader. If measure numbers given in the print seem to have been located at musically significant points, segments should be started at those points. If measure numbers appear to be located without reference to the phraseology, for instance at the beginning of each staff of the score, it is only necessary to give the correct measure number at the beginning of each braille segment.</p>
