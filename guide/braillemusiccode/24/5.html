  <h1>24. Instrumental Solos and Ensemble Parts</h1>
  <h2>24.5. Parts Printed Together in a Staff</h2>
  <p>In orchestral or other ensemble music, two similar parts, for instance oboes 1 and 2, are often printed in a single staff. If the two (or more) parts are in unison except for a few short passages, it is permissible to braille them in a single transcription, showing the places where they differ as in-accords. If the parts are independent for any considerable portion of the score, each part should be transcribed separately. The parts, intended for separate musicians, should never be given in braille as intervals.</p>
