  <h1>38. Music Drama</h1>
  <h2>38.5. Cues following Extended Rests</h2>
  <p>In a transcription of the music for a single character, it is advisable to provide a short cue of two to four bars following an extended rest, especially when there is response or overlap between the characters’ parts. The cue is given in a separate parallel, with a word line for each character included in the cue, and a music line for each. Each word line is introduced by the name of the character, italicized or fully capitalized to show that it is not to be sung; the name may be abbreviated if it is very long or includes more than one word. The music line of each part is prefaced by a word sign and an identifier of the character’s name followed by dot 3. The music is transcribed in the manner of the solo outline in an accompaniment, including only the notes, rests, and ties, without dynamics, marks of phrasing, or nuances. A note indicating that cues are included in the score must be included in the Transcriber’s Notes page.</p>
