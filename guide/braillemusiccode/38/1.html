  <h1>38. Music Drama</h1>
  <h2>38.1. Vocal Scores and Extracted Solo Parts</h2>
  <p>Transcription of the music for an opera, operetta, musical comedy, oratorio, or other form of dramatic music may be required as a part for one character extracted from the full print score, as a partial score showing parts for selected characters, or as a complete vocal score showing all of the performance materials of all characters. As with other vocal and choral music, instrumental accompaniments are not included in the transcription and are brailled separately, as described in Par. <a href="../29/8.html">29.8</a>. A score for one character is transcribed as a choral part would be done, as described in Par. <a href="../35/10.html">35.10</a>. A score including more than one part is transcribed as a choral ensemble as described in Sec. <a href="../37/1.html">37</a>. All of the conventions relative to those formats are observed. Some necessary additions and adaptations are described below.</p>
