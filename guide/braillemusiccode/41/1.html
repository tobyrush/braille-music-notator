  <h1>41. Vertical Score and Bar-by-Bar</h1>
  <h2>41.1. Historical Background</h2>
  <p>These two systems were exclusively used in the United Kingdom from about 1915 to about 1960, and although they were rejected by the Paris Conference of 1954, the very considerable production of braille music in the United Kingdom renders a description of them necessary. Certain minor details of procedure tended to vary up to the publication of <i>Key to the Braille Music Notation 1922,</i> by the Royal National Institute for the Blind, London, and one or two changes were also brought about by the Paris Conference of 1929. It is not considered essential to go into details concerning these variations, and the two systems are here described as they were presented to the Paris Conference of 1954.</p>
