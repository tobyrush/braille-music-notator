  <h1>14. Tremolo</h1>
  <h2>14.1. Types of Tremolo</h2>
  <p>There are two different types of print notation labeled &quot;tremolo&quot; by musicologists. One, often referred to as &quot;fractioning&quot; in braille, indicates a repetition of a single note or chord, usually by way of one or more slash marks through the stem or a number of dots above or below a note of longer value; the other indicates alternation between notes or parts of a chord, typically shown in print as equal note values connected by parallel lines. Either type of tremolo may be performed measured or unmeasured, that choice being made in practice by the performer(s) and not distinguished in the transcription. (See also Par. <a href="../25/6.html">25.6</a>: Tremolo in Bowed Stringed Instruments.)</p>
