  <h1>31. Harps</h1>
  <h2>31.3. Damping of Strings</h2>
  <h3>31.3.4. Damp a Specific Range of Adjacent Notes</h3>
  <p>A range of notes to be damped may be shown in print by note heads at the outer pitches to be included in the damping, connected by some graphic device in conjunction with the encircled cross. The damping sign follows the last of the sounded notes that is to be included in the damping. The first of the pair of pitches, preceded by the note-head-only sign, is given following the damping sign, and the second of the notes is represented by the appropriate interval sign, with an octave mark if necessary. Intervals are read downward in the right hand and upward in the left hand. The transcription of the device should precede a rest if one has been given in the print or is necessarily added by the transcriber.</p>
