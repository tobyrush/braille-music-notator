  <h3>31.2.3. Pedal Diagrams</h3>
  <p>A Salzedo diagram shows the position of each of the seven pedals from left to right, along a horizontal line, with a vertical intersecting line dividing the left-foot pedals (D, C, and B) from the right-foot pedals (E, F, G, and A). A mark through the horizontal line indicates the natural note, a mark above the line the flat note, and a mark below the line the sharp note. In braille the prefix <span class="braille">&gt;-</span> introduces the diagram, which is in all ways treated as a word-sign expression. The seven pedal positions follow in left-to-right succession; the high position is represented by dots 12, the intersecting position by dot 2, and the low position by dots 23. The vertical line that separates the left from the right sides of the diagram is represented by dots 123. Dot 3 always follows the last pedal mark to serve as a terminator. In every transcription that includes pedal diagrams, the prefix for pedal diagrams and a description of its use must be given in the Transcriberâ€™s Notes page of each volume in which the diagrams appear. The following modifications may be encountered:</p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Diagrams may be printed with solid (black) marks representing the pedals that are to be changed and empty (white) marks representing those that are not changed. The white marks are shown by brailling dots 13 in the places of the unchanging pedals.</li>
    <li>Partial diagrams may be printed that include only the pedals that are to be changed, or that show only a subset of the seven pedals. The presence of the cell of dots 123 separating the left from the right pedals may serve adequately to identify which pedals are affected. If there is any doubt, the complete series of seven pedals should be shown, with the cell of dots 13 representing the missing pedals.</li>
    <li>It may sometimes be advisable to adjust the arrangement of measures so that a pedal diagram may be removed to a free line above the right-hand line at the beginning of a new parallel in order not to interrupt the rhythmic continuity of the music.</li>
