  <h1>31. Harps</h1>
  <h2>31.2. Pitch Settings</h2>
  <p>All instructions about tuning and setting of pitches must be given in the transcription where they appear in print. Such instructions may be written as note names, as strings of note names, or as Salzedo diagrams. Pitch-setting instructions are transcribed as follows:</p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>When note names are employed, they are given in braille as word-sign expressions. The letter names of notes are not capitalized, and the single-cell signs for accidentals, rather than the two-cell Unified English Braille signs, are used where they appear in print. A word-sign indication consisting of a single note name must be terminated with a dot 3. When an indication consists of a string of note names, the list of names is brailled as a longer expression; the note names are separated by spaces; any commas are omitted; a terminating dot 3 immediately follows the last of the note names.</li>
    <li>A braille repeat of a measure, part-measure, or passage does not include a pitch-setting indication that occurs at the end of the original.</li>
    <li>A setting that is indicated at the beginning of the score should be given between word signs in a free line above the right-hand line, starting two cells to the right of the hand sign. If there is a concurrent word-sign expression given at the same point, the pitch adjustment may be shown in that line before the other expression. If there is not room for both expressions, the pitch adjustment should be given in an additional free line above the other expression.</li>
    <li>A change consisting of a single note name that is printed at the beginning of a measure may, optionally, be given in braille at the end of the preceding measure if there is room.</li>
  </ol>
