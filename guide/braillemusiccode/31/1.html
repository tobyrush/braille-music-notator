  <h1>31. Harps</h1>
  <h2>31.1. Standard Notation</h2>
  <p>Harp music is notated in a grand staff and in general appears very much like keyboard music. Like piano music, the right hand is usually printed in the upper staff and left hand in the lower staff, although music for either hand may be printed in either staff. Like piano music in braille, the upper line of a two-line parallel should be devoted to the music of the right hand, and the lower line for the music of the left hand, but &quot;visiting hands&quot; may occur. The hand signs are employed as they are in keyboard transcriptions. Intervals and in-accords are read downward in the right hand and upward in the left hand. When the assignment of hands is not clear, the transcriber should follow print as closely as possible.</p>
