  <h1>37. Choral Ensembles</h1>
  <h2>37.1. Expanded Bar-over-Bar Format</h2>
  <p>A score for a vocal ensemble is transcribed in bar-over-bar format, adjusted to include the lyrics above the music in each parallel. All lyrics of the parallel are given in successive braille lines, followed by all of the music lines. An instrumental accompaniment is not included in the parallel. When it is desirable to transcribe an individual part that includes divided passages as if it were an ensemble, or a subgroup of the parts of a full ensemble such as only the men’s or women’s parts, the same procedures may be used. The disposition of lines in each parallel is determined by the relationships between the lyrics and the vocal parts. The following general procedures and rules apply throughout.</p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>It is not necessary to leave a blank line between successive parallels.</li>
    <li>A measure number or rehearsal reference should be located at the margin in a free line above the first line of the parallel. A rehearsal reference should be enclosed between word signs; an actual measure number is not enclosed.</li>
    <li>A part that has rests throughout the music included in a parallel is omitted in that parallel.</li>
    <li>Word lines begin at the margin, with run-overs starting in cell 5. Run-overs of the word line are allowable only when there is only one word line in the parallel.</li>
    <li>Music lines begin in cell 3, with run-overs starting in cell 5. However, when text is given in two languages music lines begin in cell 5 with run-overs starting in cell 7. (See Par. <a href="../37/4.html">37.4</a>.) Run-overs of the music line are allowable only when there is only one music line in the parallel.</li>
    <li>Each word line and each music line in the first parallel of the braille page is introduced with the appropriate identifier giving the name of the part. The identifiers in the word lines are always followed by a space. The identifiers in the music lines are not followed by a space unless required by the alignment of the initial music signs. The identifiers need not be restated when the assignments of the lines continue unchanged in successive parallels on that page. Wherever there is a change in the assignment of the word lines, all of the word lines in the parallel must show the identifiers. Likewise, wherever there is a change in the assignment of the music lines, all of the music lines in the parallel must show the identifiers.</li>
    <li>All English lyrics are given without contractions except in chants, hymnals, and school materials for grades K–6. (See Par. <a href="../1/2_1.html">1.2.1</a>.)</li>
    <li>Syllabication, slurring, and division of words between parallels are executed as they are in vocal solo music, as described in Sec. <a href="../35/1.html">35</a>.</li>
    <li>No attempt is made to exclude dynamic markings or other expressions from the alignment. If the parallel contains more than one measure, the first signs of the measures are vertically aligned in all parts. The first note of every music line requires an octave mark, but the first notes of successive measures do not require them unless they are needed for another reason.</li>
    <li>Intervals and in-accords are read downward in soprano and alto parts and upward in tenor and bass parts.</li>
    <li>When a tenor part is printed in a treble clef without a subscript <i>8</i>, it is transcribed in the octave in which it is to be sung, as if the <i>8</i> were present.</li>
    <li>When a vocal score has been printed in a compressed format, usually in a single staff or a grand staff like a keyboard score, the parts are brailled in expanded bar-over-bar format unless a facsimile transcription is required.</li>
