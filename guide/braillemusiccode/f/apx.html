  <h1>Part IV. Appendix: Formats Not Currently In Use In BANA Countries</h1>
  <p>Note: The following sections contain descriptions of methods that readers may encounter in scores produced in earlier times or in other countries. They are not to be employed as instructions for transcribing.</p>
  <p>The text and examples in Part IV are largely excerpted from the following book, compiled by H. V. Spanner:</p>
  <p>Spanner, H. V. <i>Revised International Manual of Braille Music Notation 1956.</i> (American Edition). Part I: Western Music. Louisville: American Printing House for the Blind, 1961. Originally Published, 1956, by the World Council for the Welfare of the Blind, Paris, France.</p>
  <p>This work describes itself as &quot;based on decisions reached at the International Conference on Braille Music, Paris, 1954, with corrections authorized by World Braille Council September, 1961.&quot;</p>
  <p>At the time of publication, H. V. Spanner was Braille Music Secretary, World Council for the Welfare of the Blind and World Braille Council.</p>
