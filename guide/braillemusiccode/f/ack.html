  <h1>Acknowledgements</h1>
  
  <p>The Committee gratefully acknowledges the contributions of Christina Davidson, Ruth Rozen, and Richard Taesch, who joined in the effort as consultants. Their special knowledge of string instrument notation, along with their expertise in music braille transcription, has been invaluable.</p>
  <p>The Committee is also grateful to Pauline Leung, who reviewed and performed the initial complete proofreading of the musical examples contained within this document; the anonymous participants in the BANA technical review, whose comments resulted in many improvements in clarity; Heidi Lehmann and again Tina Davidson and Ruth Rozen, for their painstaking reviews of the first drafts of the General Index; and our colleagues on four continents, whose opinions were central to forming the BANA policies on the use of Unified English Braille in the music context.</p>
