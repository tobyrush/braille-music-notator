  <h1>29. Keyboard Instruments</h1>
  <h2>29.10. Piano Pedaling</h2>
  <p>Depression and subsequent release of the damper pedal are shown in print by the &quot;Ped.&quot; symbol and a star (or asterisk). They may also be indicated by a horizontal bracket or by the &quot;Ped.&quot; symbol followed by a bracket. It is usual to include the signs in the left-hand part in the braille text, though there will be many instances where an exact indication of the pedaling is only possible in the right-hand part, e.g., where the left hand has a measure of silence or a long note during which the pedaling is changed. It is advisable to treat the pedal-down and pedal-up indications as a pair, placing them both in the same hand part whenever possible.</p>
