  <h1>29. Keyboard Instruments</h1>
  <h2>29.3. Typical Structure of the Keyboard Music Parallel</h2>
  <h3>29.3.3. Placement of Shorter Expressions</h3>
  <p>A word-sign expression consisting of one word or of an abbreviation is brailled in the music where it occurs. It is brailled in the right-hand line if it applies to the entire texture or if it applies only to the right-hand music. If it applies only to the music of the left hand it is brailled in the left-hand line. When such an expression occurs at the beginning of a parallel, it is not included in the alignment of the musical content of the hands. The first signs of the musical content, including rests, octave marks, accidentals, or nuances, are the elements that are vertically aligned. If the expression applies to the entire texture and the first musical element of the right-hand part is a rest, the expression is brailled in the left-hand line, excluded from the alignment, and must be restated in the right-hand part following the rest. When both parts in a measure begin with expressions, no effort is made to exclude them from the alignment; the opening word signs are vertically aligned. When guide dots are required in one of the lines, they do not extend into the space above or below the expression that has been excluded from the alignment. (See Example <a href="../29/3_5.html">29.3.5-2(b)</a>.) Vertical alignment among the lines is not attempted in a parallel that includes a run-over, unless the run-over is of the last line of the parallel.</p>
