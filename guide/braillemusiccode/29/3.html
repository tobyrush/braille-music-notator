  <h1>29. Keyboard Instruments</h1>
  <h2>29.3. Typical Structure of the Keyboard Music Parallel</h2>
  <p>Keyboard music in braille is presented in bar-over-bar format, subject to the principles described in Sec. <a href="../28/1.html">28</a>, with the following additions and adjustments:</p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>The first note in each measure of each part must have an octave mark.</li>
    <li>Each parallel is introduced at the margin by the appropriate measure number, given without the numeric indicator. If the measure is a full measure, the number is followed by one space; if it is the continuation of a divided measure, the number is followed by a dot 3. When the first measure of the movement is incomplete, it is assigned the number zero. (See Example <a href="../29/3_3.html">29.3.3-1</a>.)</li>
    <li>The spaces or dot 3s must be vertically aligned throughout the page; if the numbers all have the same number of digits, they all start at the margin; if not, leading spaces are left at the margin before the shorter numbers in order to achieve the alignment.</li>
    <li>A right-hand sign follows the space or dot 3, immediately preceding the right-hand music of that measure.</li>
    <li>The left-hand sign is placed in the following line, directly below the right-hand sign, and immediately followed by the left-hand music of the measure.</li>
    <li>One space is left after the last sign of the longer of the two parts, followed by the music of the next measure in that part.</li>
    <li>The music of the remaining hand part is brailled starting immediately above or below the first note of the measure just written.</li>
    <li>The procedure continues until there is not room in both lines for a complete measure.</li>
    <li>When alignment factors or differences in the lengths of parts result in an extended blank space at the beginning or end of a measure, a series of a minimum of five guide dots (dot 3), separated from the music by a blank cell, replaces the space. Guide dots are intended to lead to something; they are not added to fill space at the end of a line.</li>
  </ol>
