  <h1>29. Keyboard Instruments</h1>
  <h2>29.15. Directions for Organ Registration</h2>
  <p>Directions for registration that occur within the music are treated as word-sign expressions. (See Pars. <a href="../29/3_3.html">29.3.3â€“29.3.5.</a>) Expressions that contain these directions are not excluded from the alignment of the parts. Registration and dynamic levels are intrinsically related; it is usually appropriate to place them within the same expression when they occur together. However, hairpin crescendos and decrescendos must not be combined with registration within a longer word-sign expression. Because of the complexity that results from the presence of multiple manuals, thorough attention must be given to the placements of registrations and to the assignments of hands to the manuals. It is permissible to place a marking that applies to the entire instrument in the right-hand line, especially if the marking is a longer expression removed to a free line above the parallel. If there is any doubt, an instruction should be placed in the line of each part to which it applies.</p>
