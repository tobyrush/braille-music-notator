  <h1>29. Keyboard Instruments</h1>
  <h2>29.1. Print Staves vis-&agrave;a-viz Braille Hand Parts</h2>
  <p>Music for piano, harpsichord, clavichord, or keyboard synthesizer is usually printed on a grand staff. The lower staff of the grand staff encompasses the left half of the range of the keyboard, and the upper staff encompasses the right half. The specific pitches of the lines and spaces are variable, and are designated by the clef signs. The result is that the lower staff usually contains the range of music to be played by the left hand and the upper staff that for the right hand. This division is not definitive; music for either hand may be notated in either staff. In braille, however, the music is presented in two successive lines of a parallel, the upper braille line containing the music for the right hand and the lower line the music for the left hand, regardless of its placement in the grand staff or the clef signs employed. (See Pars. <a href="../29/4.html">29.4–29.4.3</a> and <a href="../29/7.html">29.7</a> regarding exceptions to this arrangement.) Organ music is printed on a three-staff system. (See Pars. <a href="../29/12.html">29.12–29.16.1</a>.)</p>
