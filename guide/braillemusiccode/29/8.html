  <h1>29. Keyboard Instruments</h1>
  <h2>29.8. Keyboard Accompaniments</h2>
  <p>When a vocal or instrumental solo or a composition for a small ensemble has been printed in score form including an accompaniment for a piano or other keyboard instrument, the solo or instrumental parts are transcribed individually, and the accompaniment is transcribed separately. An outline of the solo part is included in the accompaniment to assist the player in memorizing his part. This outline is placed above the right-hand part, marked with the solo-outline indicator <span class="braille">&quot;></span> treated as a hand sign, directly above the right-hand sign. The marginal measure number is placed in this line instead of in the right-hand line. The outline includes only notes, ties, rests, and other essential marks such as fermatas. It does not include nuances, slurs, word-sign expressions, or, in the case of vocal music, lyrics. Expressions that are removed to a free line above the parallel are placed above this line; directions should not appear between the outline part and the right-hand part. Any rehearsal reference mark that is shown with the solo or instrumental part must be included in the accompaniment, placed two cells to the right of the solo-outline indicator in a free line above the outline and above any other expressions. When the accompaniment is for an ensemble, the most prominent elements should be shown in the outline; the outline should not be expanded to more than one line. If the keyboard accompaniment doubles all or most of the music of the solo or ensemble, the outline may be omitted entirely.</p>
