  <h1>21. Annotations and Variants</h1>
  <h2>21.6. Variations in Print Type</h2>
  <p>The sign <span class="braille">,5</span> is used to designate printed notes or rests smaller than normal; the sign <span class="braille">;5</span> is used for those larger than usual. These signs are placed before any bowing signs, ornaments, signs of expression, accidentals, or octave marks. These signs must be employed in facsimile transcriptions. Their use is optional in transcriptions that are not facsimile. The transcriber must decide whether the differences in size among notes is musically significant or is merely a visual convenience. Either sign may be doubled by writing its second cell twice. The doubling is terminated by writing the two-cell sign before the last affected note. The following example is shown transcribed in three different ways. Version (a) is a facsimile transcription. Version (b) does not show the differences in type. Version (c) is one in which the transcriber has determined that the sizes of the notes are essential to interpretation for performance and is based on the assumption that functionally the smaller print notes are the normal size and the larger ones are the exception. (Notes actually larger than the normal size are very rarely found in print music.) Each of the transcriptions is correct; which one is most appropriate must be decided by the transcriber, based on the musical context.</p>
