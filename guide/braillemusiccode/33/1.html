  <h1>33. Instrumental Ensemble Scores</h1>
  <h2>33.1. Application of Bar-over-Bar Format</h2>
  <p>A score for an instrumental ensemble, including an orchestra or band, employs the basic principles of bar-over-bar format as described in Sec. <a href="../28/1.html">28</a>. It is transcribed as a condensed score, each parallel containing only the music of the instruments that have music to play in those measures. An instrument that has only rests in those measures is omitted from the parallel. Consequently, how many lines are in a parallel may vary from one to many. This format is used in braille whether the print score is a full score that shows all rests in all parts, or is a condensed or &quot;miniature&quot; score that shows only active parts in variable systems. It may often be necessary for the transcriber to make adjustments and additions to the following directions and rules, but these must always be based on the principles set forth in this section.</p>
