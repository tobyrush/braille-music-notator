  <h1>33. Instrumental Ensemble Scores</h1>
  <h2>33.2. List of Instruments</h2>
  <h3>33.2.2. Numbering Included in Abbreviations</h3>
  <p>When there are more than one of an instrument in the list and they are numbered, the number is given as part of the abbreviation, as a lower-cell number without a numeric indicator, before the dot 3 that always concludes the abbreviation. When two or more parts for like instruments are combined in a staff, the numbers are included in the abbreviation in order from larger to smaller. Thus, the numbers are brailled from lowest part to highest part, in the same order as the parts will occur in intervals or in-accords in the score. (See Par. <a href="../33/4_2.html">33.4.2</a> and &quot;Oboes 1&amp;2&quot; in the Example below.) Sometimes a part that is numbered may be further divided; in that case, the second number is given as an upper-cell number, without a numeric indicator, before the dot 3. (See &quot;Violins I-1&quot; and &quot;Violins I-2&quot; in the Example below.)</p>
