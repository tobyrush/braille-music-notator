  <h1>33. Instrumental Ensemble Scores</h1>
  <h2>33.3. Page Layout</h2>
  <p>No blank line is required below the running head at the top of a braille page, or between the music heading and the first line of music or a free line that contains text. A blank line is always required above the music heading except when it is at the top of the braille page immediately following the running head. When there are two or more parallels on a page, each succeeding parallel is preceded by at least two free lines. The first of these lines must be blank; the second, and further lines if they are needed, may contain section headings, rehearsal references, measure numbers, and/or longer word-sign expressions. Every parallel must be completed on the braille page on which it begins. If, however, there are so many parts to be included that they cannot be contained on a single page, the parallel may be started at the top of a left-hand page and completed on the facing right- hand page. The point of division should be made between related groups of instruments if possible, and the numbers of lines on the two pages should be as nearly equal as possible.</p>
