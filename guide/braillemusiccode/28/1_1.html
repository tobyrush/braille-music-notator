  <h2>28.1. General Principles</h2>
  <h3>28.1.1. Dividing a Measure between Parallels</h3>
  <p>A measure may be started in one parallel and continued in the following one. The point at which the division occurs must be the same in all parts. The division is indicated at the end of each braille line by a music hyphen or a measure-division sign, whichever is appropriate. The rhythmic values of notes or rests of a measure may never be altered to accommodate division of the measure. The point of interruption should be made between beats or other natural division of the music. Good musical judgment must be exercised. It is often preferable not to divide a short measure merely to fill space if musical continuity would be sacrificed, but to carry the complete measure into the new parallel.</p>
