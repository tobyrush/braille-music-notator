  <h1>28. Instrumental Bar-Over-Bar Format</h1>
  <h2>28.1. General Principles</h2>
  <p>Bar-over-bar format is used to display music printed in systems of two or more staves. The music for each measure is presented in a chart-like layout consisting of one line of braille for each hand or instrumental part. The first music elements of all of the parts in each measure are aligned vertically. There is generally no attempt to align the beats within the measure. (See Pars. <a href="../29/5.html">29.5</a>, <a href="../30/3.html">30.3</a>, and <a href="../30/4.html">30.4â€“30.4.2</a> regarding exceptions to this principle.) The group of lines is termed a parallel. Each line of the parallel must contain exactly the same amount of rhythmic value, beginning and ending at the same point. A parallel may contain a single measure, part of a measure, or more than one measure. A parallel must always be completed on the page on which it begins.</p>
