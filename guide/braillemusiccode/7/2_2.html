  <h2>7.2. Real-Time Devices</h2>
  <h3>7.2.2. Time Indicated by &quot;Tick&quot; Marks</h3>
  <p>When durations of notes, silences, or actions are indicated by &quot;tick&quot; marks above a staff that indicate the passing of seconds, the sign for a second (dots 45) is written in the music line and must be preceded and followed by spaces unless accompanied by a number. In that case, the sign for a second precedes the numeric indicator, and the combination must be preceded and followed by spaces. If the duration of time is shown in print with a line of extension and no number, the line of duration (dots 36, 36) appears in the braille. This line must be preceded and followed by spaces. In Example 7.2.2-1 the numbers of seconds from the beginning of the passage have been brailled at the margins at the beginnings of segments, where measure numbers would ordinarily appear. The beginning of the staff, the dashed bar lines, and the ticks are understood to mark the beginnings of seconds.</p>
