  <h1>26. Fretted Plucked String Instruments</h1>
  <h2>26.2. Interpretation of Staff Notation</h2>
  <p>In general, music for a plucked instrument is written on a staff with treble clef and is brailled in single-line format. It often appears indistinguishable from that for any other single-line instrument, especially a bowed-string. It may appear as single notes, chords, two- or three-voiced polyphony, or any sequence or combination of those textures. While music for a variety of instruments may be encountered (e.g., guitars, mandolins, banjos, and ukuleles), most of the following rules and examples represent music for the classical guitar. Music for classical guitar is notated an octave higher than it is to sound. It is brailled as it is notated, without any explanation. Intervals and in-accords are read downward. Correlatively, when numbers are used to identify the strings of the instrument, they are usually given from the highest-pitched to the lowest.</p>
