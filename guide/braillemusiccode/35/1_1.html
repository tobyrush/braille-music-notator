  <h1>35. Solo Songs and Choral Parts</h1>
  <h2>35.1. Principles of Line-by-Line Format</h2>
  <h3>35.1.1. The Lyrics</h3>
  <p>The vocal text is written in uncontracted Unified English Braille, with the following exceptions and stipulations:</p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>The hyphens that are given in the print to separate the syllables of a word are not included in the braille, unless the words are nonsense syllables or otherwise require unusual pronunciation. When a word is divided between syllables from one parallel into the next, the literary hyphen is placed once at the end of the line, according to ordinary literary practice.</li>
    <li>Contracted Unified English Braille may be used when the transcription is of chants, hymnals, or school materials for grades Kâ€“6. (See Par. <a href="../1/2_1.html">1.2.1</a>.)</li>
    <li>When vocal texts other than those specified in (b) above are prepared in contracted braille at the special request of the end user, the uncontracted words are written, text only, in verse or paragraph form as a part of the preliminary pages of the transcription. (See also Par. <a href="../1/2_1.html">1.2.1</a>.)</li>
    <li>Accented letters in foreign words in an English language context are indicated according to <i>The Rules of Unified English Braille</i>.</li>
    <li>Accented letters and unique punctuation in a foreign language context are given with the characters for those symbols in that language. Those characters must be given in the Special Symbols page of any transcription in which they appear. (Consult <i>World Braille Usage</i>, available on-line from several websites, or other relevant resource.)</li>
    <li>If the complete vocal text of the original language of a song in two languages is completely in International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) symbols, then IPA must be used in braille. In this case code switching indicators are not added; a statement describing the use of IPA must be included on the Transcriber's Notes page and all IPA symbols appearing in the transcription must be listed on the Special Symbols page. However, if sections of IPA symbols appear within a vocal text in any language, then code switching must be employed as described in <i>The Rules of Unified English Braille</i>.</li>
