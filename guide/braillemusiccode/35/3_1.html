  <h3>35.3.1. Continuation of the Vowel Sound in the Text</h3>
  <p>The letter, or group of letters, representing the vowel sound that is to be carried over must be written twice. It is first written at the end of the line in which the word begins, followed by a hyphen. It is restated at the beginning of the next corresponding word line, preceded by a hyphen. When the vowel sound includes more than one letter, the entire group of letters is given identically in both iterations. Some representative divided sounds are &quot;tai- -ail,&quot; &quot;crow- -owd,&quot; &quot;they- -ey,&quot; &quot;rou- -ound,&quot; &quot;ou- -ought,&quot; and &quot;beau- -eautiful.&quot; If contracted braille is being employed, a contraction that is normally used may be employed in both iterations as long as all letters comprising the vowel sound are present (for example, &quot;crow- -owd&quot;). However, a contraction that includes a letter that is not part of the vowel content of the syllable may not be used at either point, and contraction rules must be observed. For instance, the contraction for &quot;the&quot; may not be used in &quot;they- -ey,&quot; the contraction for &quot;ound&quot; may not be used in &quot;rou- -ound,&quot; the short form of "ought" may not be used in &quot;ou- -ought,&quot; and the contraction for &quot;ea&quot; cannot be used in &quot;beau- -eautiful&quot; because of its proximity to the hyphen in the continuation.</p>
