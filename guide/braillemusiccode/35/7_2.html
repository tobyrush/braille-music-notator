  <h1>35. Solo Songs and Choral Parts</h1>
  <h2>35.7. Multiple Verses</h2>
  <h3>35.7.2. Strophic Songs with Refrains</h3>
  <p>When a section of music printed with several verses is followed by a refrain that has only one set of words, the first verse and the refrain are transcribed as described in Par. <a href="../35/7.html">35.7</a>. The refrain must be started in a new parallel. The first word line of the refrain is introduced by the word &quot;Refrain&quot; at the margin, fully capitalized or italicized to make it clear that it is not to be sung, whether or not the word appears in the print. If the print shows &quot;Chorus&quot; or some similar word, that word is used instead of &quot;Refrain.&quot; The texts of the remaining verses are given as described above; however, the text of the refrain is not restated but is supplanted by the word &quot;Refrain&quot; (or &quot;Chorus&quot;) again fully capitalized or italicized. (This example is minimized to illustrate the procedure compactly.)</p>
