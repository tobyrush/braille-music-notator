  <h1>35. Solo Songs and Choral Parts</h1>
  <h2>35.10. Parts Extracted from Choral Scores</h2>
  <h3>35.10.1. Divided Choral Parts</h3>
  <p>When two or more choral parts are written together on one staff, they should be transcribed separately unless they are nearly always in unison. Where a part is only occasionally divided, the voices may be transcribed together as one part, showing the measures where they differ by means of in-accords. In-accord parts are brailled from highest to lowest in soprano and alto parts, and lowest to highest in tenor and bass. The first measure of a passage in which the part is divided should be prefaced, unspaced, by the warning sign <span class="braille">/</span> in the braille;the first note following this sign requires an octave mark. Alternatively, where a part is divided extensively and it is desirable to include all of the voices in the same transcription, it may be preferable to treat the part as an ensemble and braille the music as described in Sec. <a href="../37/1.html">37</a>.</p>
