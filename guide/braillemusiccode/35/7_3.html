  <h1>35. Solo Songs and Choral Parts</h1>
  <h2>35.7. Multiple Verses</h2>
  <h3>35.7.3. Alternating Single and Multiple Lyrics</h3>
  <p>If a song consists of sections that have only one line of lyrics alternated with sections that have two lines of lyrics, it is permissible to expand the parallel to three lines where there are two lines of lyrics and resume the normal two-line parallels where there is again only one line of lyrics. At the point where the expansion occurs, each of the lines is introduced by the number 1 or 2 enclosed between literary parentheses followed by a space. This exceptional procedure should only be used under three conditions: the syllabication of the two sets of words must be identical, there must not be alternate endings (voltas), and no run-overs of the word lines are allowed. In a song in which the sequence of sections is complex, or there are alternate endings combined with multiple verses, it is usually better to omit any print repeat signs and to transcribe the music fully, in the correct order, explaining that fact in a transcriberâ€™s note. (This example is minimized to illustrate the procedure compactly.)</p>
