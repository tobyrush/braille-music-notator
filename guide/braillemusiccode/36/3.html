  <h1>36. Chord Symbols with Lyrics</h1>
  <h2>36.3. Alignment of Chord Symbols below Lyrics</h2>
  <p>The placement of the initial capital sign of each chord (or a hyphen preceding it) is determined according to whether the chord is to be played with, before, during, or after the word or syllable is sounded. Word repeat signs and all punctuation marks, including apostrophes, in the word line are disregarded with respect to alignment. A space is only required between successive chord symbols when the first chord symbol contains a second capital letter that is the name of a note, which could be mistaken for the beginning of a new chord symbol. The presence of a letter, such as a capital <i>M</i> representing the word &quot;major,&quot; that is not the name of a note, cannot be so mistaken.</p>
