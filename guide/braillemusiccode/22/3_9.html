  <h1>22. Nuances and Verbal Expressions</h1>
  <h2>22.3. Words and Abbreviated Words of Expression</h2>
  <h3>22.3.9. Expressions Executed during Sustained Notes</h3>
  <p>When print expression marks have been placed so that they are clearly intended to be executed rhythmically at intermediate places during a sustained note, the transcriber must not yield to the temptation to re-write the value of the sustained note as tied notes of smaller values. Instead, full- or part-measure in-accords consisting entirely of rests should be employed, with the expression marks placed at the correct points. Each rest must be preceded by dot 5 to indicate that it does not appear in the print. All marks of expression that occur within the span covered in the in-accord must be placed in the in-accord of rests. In order to avoid many repetitions of the dot 5, the number of rests should
    be as small as possible, a quarter and an eighth rest, for instance, being shown as a dotted quarter rest.</p>
