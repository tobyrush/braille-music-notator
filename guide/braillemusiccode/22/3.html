  <h1>22. Nuances and Verbal Expressions</h1>
  <h2>22.3. Words and Abbreviated Words of Expression</h2>
  <p>Abbreviations, single words of expression, longer expressions consisting of words and/or abbreviations, and terminators associated with these expressions are introduced by the word sign > in braille. Care must be taken in placement of expressions according to their meanings, regardless of their position in print; a tempo indication may be placed before a rest, but a dynamic marking or an indication of articulation should only be placed before a note. Any number of single words, abbreviations, and other expressions that do not contain spaces may be brailled without interruption, each being introduced by the word sign. These expressions are brailled before any of the signs of Table <a href="../t/1_22.html">22(A)</a>. (See Pars. <a href="../29/3_3.html">29.3.3</a>&ndash;<a href="../29/3_5.html">29.3.5</a> regarding placement of word- sign expressions in keyboard music, and Pars. <a href="../33/4.html">33.4</a> and <a href="../33/4_5.html">33.4.5</a> regarding instrumental ensembles.) All word-sign expressions:</p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>are given in uncontracted braille in the applicable literary code: in an English context, accented letters are brailled in Unified English Braille (see Example <a href="../22/3_8.html">22.3.8-1</a>), but the alphabet and accented letter signs of the original language are used in vocal music and when a publication is entirely printed in a foreign language;</li>
    <li>are brailled without capitalization;</li>
    <li>use the literary characters for all punctuation except that (1) dot 3 <span class="braille">'</span> is used to represent a period, and (2) the special parenthesis sign <span class="braille">7</span> is used when print parentheses enclose all or part of the expression (see Par. <a href="../22/3_3.html">22.3.3</a> for the exception regarding parenthetical dynamic markings);</li>
    <li>must be followed by dot 3 if the following sign contains dot 1, 2, or 3, except when (1) it is the last sign of the measure, (2) the following sign is a word sign, or (3) a dot 3 representing a period is already present; and</li>
    <li>require that an octave mark be given for the next note.</li>
  </ol>
