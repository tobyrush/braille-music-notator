  <h1>30. Figured Bass and Harmonic Analysis</h1>
  <h2>30.2. Figured Bass in Horizontal Mode</h2>
  <p>In the horizontal manner of presentation, the figured bass is indicated in braille with the figured-bass sign <span class="braille">;&gt;</span> at the beginning of each parallel in bar-over-bar format or at the beginning of the movement in single-line format. Like a hand sign, the figured- bass sign requires a following dot 3 if the next cell contains a dot 1, 2, or 3. The signs in Table <a href="../26/1.html">26</a> only bear their special meaning when the passage in which they occur is preceded by this sign. This line is the left-hand line in keyboard music or the pedal line in organ music, and the figured-bass sign is substituted for the left-hand or pedal-line sign. When it is the line of a bass instrument in an ensemble score, the figured-bass sign is an added sign. The figures associated with a note are brailled following the note and after a single slur or a tie, with the following stipulations:</p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>The vertical columns of figures in the print are always transcribed from the lowest upward, even though they are conventionally spoken downward.</li>
    <li>A numeric indicator must indicate the beginning of each single figure or column of figures, even if the figure is an accidental, an oblique stroke, or other feature.</li>
    <li>This procedure is an exception to the general principle that the first note following any occurrence of a numeric indicator must have an octave mark; the note following a figured bass symbol only requires an octave mark if it would otherwise have one.</li>
    <li>In a string of figures, an omitted figure is represented by dot 3. If such horizontal alignment of the figures in print does not appear exact, the transcriber should, nevertheless, follow it as closely as possible without attempting any correction on his own responsibility.</li>
    <li>It is permissible to use the music hyphen between columns of figures, but it must not be used between figures in the same column.</li>
  </ol>
