  <h1>32. Accordions</h1>
  <h2>32.1. Accordion Notation</h2>
  <h3>32.1.1. Left-Hand Bass and Chord Buttons</h3>
  <p>In print, the notes of the basses (the first two rows of buttons) occur in the lower part of the staff with stems turned up. Notes for chords (the remaining four rows) occur in the upper part of the staff with stems turned down. With the six-row accordion being used for illustration here, the buttons of row 3 activate major chords, row 4 minor chords, row 5 dominant-seventh chords, and row 6 diminished-seventh chords. Any note for the left hand, regardless of its position on the staff, can be played on one button only. Since octave marks are thus rendered unnecessary, the same signs are used to number the rows of buttons. The signs for rows of buttons precede the notes immediately and must not be separated from them by any other signs. A row sign remains in effect until it is contradicted by another row sign. A row sign in effect must be restated at the beginning of a new braille line or when it follows an interruption such as a braille measure-number repeat. Notes and rests are, of  course, written in the normal manner. Example 32.1.1-1 shows a right-hand melody along with alternating basses and chords in the left hand.</p>
