  <h1>32. Accordions</h1>
  <h2>32.1. Accordion Notation</h2>
  <p>There are many sizes and models of accordions and concertinas, as well as differing print systems of notation. The present work can set forth only the basic principles of the braille notation. The transcriber should make adjustments for special cases and provide a clear explanation of these in the transcriptions. The system of notation presented here is adapted for a piano accordion that has a piano-like keyboard for the right hand and six rows of buttons for the left hand. Music for this instrument is printed in a grand staff. It is transcribed in bar-over-bar format. The upper staff contains the music for the right hand and is transcribed in the first line of the parallel, exactly as is piano music, indicated by the right-hand sign. The lower staff contains the music for the left hand, and is transcribed in the second line of the parallel, as described in the following paragraphs. The signs only bear their special significance when the passage is preceded by the button-row notation sign <span class="braille">,&gt;</span> which is treated as a hand sign.</p>
